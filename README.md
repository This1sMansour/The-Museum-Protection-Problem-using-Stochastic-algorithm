# The-Museum-Protection-Problem-using-Stochastic-algorithm
The museum protection problem, is we have a limited number of cameras, and with those exact number of cameras, we want to cover the most amount of area of the museum as possible. In this work, by using different stochastic algorithms, and changing the settings I tried to increase the fitness of my algorithm.

In this work, Python was used as the main programming language, and the Deap Python library, which is used for evolutionary algorithms.
