# The-Museum-Protection-Problem-using-Stochastic-algorithm
The museum protection problem, is we have limited number of camera, and with those exact number of cameras we want to cover the most amount of area of the museum as possible. In this work, by using different stochastic algorithms, and changing the settings I tried increase the fitness of my algorihm.
